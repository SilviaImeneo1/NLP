# Character-level CNN 

This project is an adaptation of the work from https://github.com/protonx-tf-03-projects/CharCNN.  
The objective is to use TensorFlow framework to implement the character-level CNN to perform English text classification.  
It is based on the paper "Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification" by Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, Yann LeCun (https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01626).

### Model Architecture

This model utilizes a convolutional neural network to extract features of sentences.  

## Dataset

The dataset used is the Amazon Reviews for Sentiment Analysis (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews).
