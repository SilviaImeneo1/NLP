# CNN for text classification

This project has been carried out for the final exam of Natural Language Processing, A.Y. 2023-2024, taught by professor Alberto Cazzaniga, at University of Trieste, within the Master's Degree in Data Science and Scientific Computing.
The goal is to build small and large CNN models to be applied on different size datasets, for text classification in sentiment analyis.
It is an adaptation of the work from https://github.com/protonx-tf-03-projects/CharCNN.  
The objective is to use TensorFlow framework to implement a CNN model to perform English text classification.  
It is based on the paper "Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification" by Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, Yann LeCun (https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01626).

### Model Architecture

This model utilizes a convolutional neural network to extract features of sentences.  

### Dataset

The dataset used is the Amazon Reviews for Sentiment Analysis (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews).
