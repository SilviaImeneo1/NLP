# CNN for text classification

This project has been carried out for the final exam of Natural Language Processing, A.Y. 2023-2024, taught by professor Alberto Cazzaniga, at University of Trieste, within the Master's Degree in Data Science and Scientific Computing.

The goal was to build small and large CNN models, to be applied on different size datasets, for text classification in sentiment analyis.

The code is an adaptation of the work from https://github.com/protonx-tf-03-projects/CharCNN and it is based on the paper "Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification" by Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, Yann LeCun (https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01626).

### How to replicate the study
The dataset used is the [Amazon Reviews for Sentiment Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews) and it can be cleaned by using the steps indicated in [this Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hL6OKiYTZLcV7mN5-W1xCv5GCRhwqnTW).

The training and testing steps performed in the analysis can be replicated by following the instructions on [this other Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EusrIZ0Uqx1DyhQlK49d1b0EPz1N6Nxe#scrollTo=XoQJF0zrEKS6).
